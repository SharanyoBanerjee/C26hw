My first Indian style Chowmien prepatration.....
Chowmien preparation (points to remember)
1.cut the vegetables into small pieces(onion,cauliflower,potato).
2.take a big bowl and add little bit of sunflower oil in it(wait till the oil becomes warm).
3.keep the chowmien in a big bowl filled with very hot water for some time.
4.take out the chowmien outside the hot water and keep it in dry bowl(drain the water).
